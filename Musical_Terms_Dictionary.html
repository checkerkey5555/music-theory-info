               Common Time is the same thing as 4/4 Time. It can be referred to by a “C” symbol, but it is more common 
               to see 4/4. Cut Time, however, is commonly indicated by the symbol “C” with a slash in the middle of it. 
               This means that it is actually 2/4 Time notated and executed like 4/4 Time, except with the beat lengths
               doubled.

               A type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type. The
               contralto’s vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical
               to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F3) to the second F above middle C
               (F5), although some voices reach beyond.

               by a musician or small group to make an impromptu, extemporised arrangement of a song, or “fake it”.

               A vocal music form that flourished in the Renaissance. Generally written for four to six voices, madrigals are
               usually set to short love poems. The madrigal is characterised by word-painting and harmonic and rhythmic       
               contrast. In the madrigal, each line has its own tune, rather than the entire composition having a single tune
               with harmonic accompaniment.

               A song written in commemoration and celebration of a particular event, object, or person. Purcell and Handel
               were important composers of odes in English Baroque music. One of the duties of the Master of the King’s Musick
               (the most important royal ensemble in England during the Baroque  Era) was to compose odes for special occasions
               such as New Year’s Day, birthdays, deaths, etc.

               The ocarina is an ancient wind musical instrument—a type of vessel flute. Variations exist, but a typical ocarina
               is an enclosed space with four to twelve finger holes and a mouthpiece that projects from the body. It is        
               traditionally made from clay or ceramic, but other materials are also used—such as plastic, wood, glass, metal,
               or bone.

               common ways are numbers, roman numerals, and names (referring to function).

               Also called a half step or a half tone, it is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal 
               music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It is defined as the interval between
               two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale. For example, C is adjacent to C♯; the interval between them is a semitone.

               The fourth tone of a major or minor scale. Music which modulates often modulates into the subdominant when the            
               leading tone is lowered by a half step to the subtonic (B to B♭ in the key of C). Modulation into the
               subdominant key often creates a sense of musical relaxation; as opposed to modulation into dominant            
               (fifth scale degree), which increases tension. See:
