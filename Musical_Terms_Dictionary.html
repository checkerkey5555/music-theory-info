|   of it. This means that it is actually 2/4 Time notated and executed            |

|   similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to               |
|   that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F3)            |
|   to the second F above middle C (F5), although some voices reach beyond.        |

|   A vocal music form that flourished in the Renaissance. Generally written       |
|   for four to six voices, madrigals are usually set to short love poems.         |
|   The madrigal is characterized by word-painting and harmonic and rhythmic       |
|   contrast. In the madrigal, each line has its own tune, rather than the         |
|   entire composition having a single tune with harmonic accompaniment.           |

|   A song written in commemoration and celebration of a particular event,         |
|   object, or person. Purcell and Handel were important composers of odes         |
|   in English Baroque music. One of the duties of the Master of the King’s        |
|   Musick (the most important royal ensemble in England during the Baroque        | 
|   Era) was to compose odes for special occasions such as New Year’s Day,         |
|   birthdays, deaths, etc.                                                        |

|   The ocarina is an ancient wind musical instrument—a type of vessel flute.      |
|   Variations exist, but a typical ocarina is an enclosed space with four to      |
|   twelve finger holes and a mouthpiece that projects from the body. It is        |
|   traditionally made from clay or ceramic, but other materials are also          |
|   used—such as plastic, wood, glass, metal, or bone.                             |

|   a wind/keyboard instrument, usually with many sets of pipes controlled         |
|   from two or more manuals (keyboards), including a set of pedals played by the  |
|   organist's feet (a set of mechanical or electrical "stops" allow the player    |
|   to open or close the flow of air to selected groups of pipes)                  |
|                                                                                  |

|   a short rhythmic/melodic idea that is repeated exactly over and over           |

|   note by comparing it to a reference note and identifying the interval          |

|   to the tonic (the first and main note of the scale from which each             |

|   size of intervals and chords, and whether they are major or minor.             |
|   Scale Degrees may be identified in several ways. The most common ways          |
|   are numbers, roman numerals, and names (referring to function).                |

|   Also called a half step or a half tone, it is the smallest musical             |
|   interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered            |
|   the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It is defined as the             |
|   interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale. For example,           |
|   C is adjacent to C♯; the interval between them is a semitone.                  |
|                                                                                  |

|   Chords consisting of a triad plus a note forming an interval of a              |
|   seventh above the chord’s root. Though there are different types,              |
|   when not otherwise specified, a “seventh chord” usually means a                |
|   Dominant Seventh Chord: a major triad together with a minor seventh.           |
|   However, there are several different types of Seventh Chords:                  |

|   The fourth tone of a major or minor scale.                                     |
|   Music which modulates often modulates into the subdominant when the            |
|   leading tone is lowered by a half step to the subtonic (B to B♭ in             |
|   the key of C). Modulation into the subdominant key often creates a             |
|   sense of musical relaxation; as opposed to modulation into dominant            |
|   (fifth scale degree), which increases tension. See:                            |
