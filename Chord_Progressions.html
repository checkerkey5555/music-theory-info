             The “La Folia” progression                                                      
             It’s so simple but I just love how it dabs between the minor and relative       
             major tonality. This chord progression is very old (hundreds of years old) and 
             has been used throughout history up to today. It originally comes a musical      
             form known as “La Folia” which was basically a theme and variations over a      
             chord progression. Although originally many folias had their distinct chord     
             progressions the own above become very standard by the baroque era (in a         
             compound period form: one round go the progression ending                        
             on a half cadence and the next one on an authentic cadence.)                     
             Even in the late romantic era folias were still composed                         
             (Rachmaninoff made one for example.)                                             
             The folia is similar to the passacaglia and other ground                         
             bass progressions and forms.                                                     
                                                                                              
             this was said by a freindly redditor

             its a fun evil chord progression with my prefered way of playing this the bass   
             should go is 1-7-4-3-5 and the chord inversion only really changed space twice
